      - [webpack-visualizer-plugin](https://npmjs.org/package/webpack-visualizer-plugin) creates an HTML file that shows how heavy our JS/CSS is

## Quickstart

fork/clone the repo, then, inside the folder,

install the necessary packages

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the app
```bash
yarn start
```

It's possible that you may have to interrupt the first build (`ctrl-c`), and run `yarn start` again.  
This only happens on the first build.


## Structure

There's `README.md` in each directory that explains its purpose
